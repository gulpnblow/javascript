<h2>HTML</h2>


    

<p>Hypertext Markup Language(HTML)is the standard
   markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong>  and web applications.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from
local storage and render them into multimedia web pages.
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally 
included cues for the appearance of the documents.</P>

<p style="margin-top:70px;">This specification should be read like all other specifications. First, it should be read cover-to-cover, 
multiple times. Then, it should be read backwards at least once. Then it should be read by picking random sections 
from the contents list and following all the cross-references.
A described in the conformance requirements section below, this specification describes conformance criteria for
a variety of conformance classes. In particular, there are conformance requirements that apply to producers, 
for example authors and the documents they create, and there are conformance requirements that apply to consumers, 
for example web browsers. They can be distinguished by what they are requiring:  requirement on a producer states 
what is allowed, while a requirement on a consumer states how software is to act.</P>
